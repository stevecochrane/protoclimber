### Branches

- proto-1
  - Press Z to move left (left-hand movement) and X to move right (right-head movement).
  - Hold Up to move up or Down to move down with each Z or X button press.
  - Inspired by the movement of Toobin'.
  - It's nice how this mirrors the left and right hands, but being able to hold one direction and move in the other direction seems wrong.
- proto-2
  - Hold a direction and press X to move in that direction. Z has no effect now.
  - Loses the feeling of using two hands, but much easier to mentally grasp, and frees up the Z button for something else.
- proto-3
  - Adds a stamina bar that depletes with each button press, and regenerates slowly over time.
  - Inspired by the temperature meter in Excitebike.
  - At the moment it's too easy to get stuck and this should really regenerate faster if it stays.
  - This would also need some polish like a visual indication that your character is too tired to move.
- proto-4
  - Adds a charged jump mechanic, where if you hold the jump button down, a new meter is charged, and at a full charge the jump is twice as strong.
- proto-5
  - Adds the ability to slowly climb in any direction by holding down that direction.
  - Moving in bursts or with the charged jump now consumes more stamina as a result (and arguably should consume even more).
- proto-6
  - Adds the ability to grab onto and let go of the wall with the B button.
  - Since there is no ground movement yet, all you can do once you've let go is grab onto the wall again.
  - The player now maintains their current X velocity from when they let go of the wall until they hit the ground.
- proto-7
  - To this point, the player could immediately start moving in a direction as soon as they grab on to the wall, which doesn't feel right.
  - Now after grabbing the wall, directional controls are non-functional until a short time after the player has stopped sliding down.
- proto-8
  - Added the ability to move and jump while on the ground.
- proto-9
  - Hitting the A button while climbing now takes you off of the wall.
- proto-10
  - There are now areas on the wall where the player cannot climb.
  - Pressing the B button to grab the wall when over these zones has no effect.
  - Attempting to climb onto these no-climbing zones will stop you at the border.
- proto-11
  - Stamina is now only restored when on the ground, and the rate of stamina gain has increased.
  - Stamina now gradually decreases when climbing the wall, even when not boosting.
  - If you run out of stamina while climbing you now fall off the wall.
- proto-12
  - Climbing movement is now grid-based. Pressing an arrow key while climbing will move you one tile in that direction.
  - When grabbing on to the wall you are now snapped to the tile grid.
  - Stamina is now drained with each move. It also continues to drain even when still, but this idle stamina drain is now much slower.
- proto-13
  - The player now has air control, just like on the ground.
  - The air control implementation isn't sophisticated yet so it's overriding the charged jump's horizontal movement, so that will need refinement later.
- proto-14
  - The player now has to hold a direction to climb in that direction.
  - The player now has a simple animation when climbing where they rock back and forth a bit.
  - Climbing in eight directions is now supported.
- proto-15
  - Added a slight delay between movement steps that makes climbing feel a little more deliberate.
- proto-16
  - Replaced the stamina bar, which used to be a range of 0 to 100 values, to a segmented bar with 0 to 18 values. This is hopefully easier to parse.
  - For now, stamina is back to an instant recharge when you touch the ground, with no drain while on the wall, but that might be restored later.
- proto-17
  - The B button now does nothing, and you can instead hold Up to grab on to the wall. More conventional this way.
- proto-18
  - Holding the A button now charges a jump. If fully charged (0.5 seconds) the player jumps 1.5x the normal jump height.
  - To allow for this, jumping now happens on the release of the jump button rather than the initial press.
- proto-19
  - The player can no longer start charging a jump while in midair.
  - If the A button is held down when in midair, a charged jump starts as soon as the player hits the ground.
- proto-20
  - Added a new 'AvalancheGenerator' object that drops 'Avalanche' objects from the top of the screen, which hurt the player on contact.
  - Added a new 'HazardCircle' object that flies in a circle and hurts the player on contact.
