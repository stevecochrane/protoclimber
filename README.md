### Branches

- proto-1
  - Press Z to move left (left-hand movement) and X to move right (right-head movement).
  - Hold Up to move up or Down to move down with each Z or X button press.
  - Inspired by the movement of Toobin'.
  - It's nice how this mirrors the left and right hands, but being able to hold one direction and move in the other direction seems wrong.
- proto-2:
  - Hold a direction and press X to move in that direction. Z has no effect now.
  - Loses the feeling of using two hands, but much easier to mentally grasp, and frees up the Z button for something else.
- proto-3:
  - Adds a stamina bar that depletes with each button press, and regenerates slowly over time.
  - Inspired by the temperature meter in Excitebike.
  - At the moment it's too easy to get stuck and this should really regenerate faster if it stays.
  - This would also need some polish like a visual indication that your character is too tired to move.
- proto-4:
  - Adds a charged jump mechanic, where if you hold the jump button down, a new meter is charged, and at a full charge the jump is twice as strong.
- proto-5:
  - Adds the ability to slowly climb in any direction by holding down that direction.
  - Moving in bursts or with the charged jump now consumes more stamina as a result (and arguably should consume even more).
- proto-6:
  - Adds the ability to grab onto and let go of the wall with the B button.
  - Since there is no ground movement yet, all you can do once you've let go is grab onto the wall again.
  - The player now maintains their current X velocity from when they let go of the wall until they hit the ground.
- proto-7:
  - To this point, the player could immediately start moving in a direction as soon as they grab on to the wall, which doesn't feel right.
  - Now after grabbing the wall, directional controls are non-functional until a short time after the player has stopped sliding down.
- proto-8:
  - Added the ability to move and jump while on the ground.
- proto-9:
  - Hitting the A button while climbing now takes you off of the wall.
