### Branches

- proto-1
  - Press Z to move left (left-hand movement) and X to move right (right-head movement).
  - Hold Up to move up or Down to move down with each Z or X button press.
  - Inspired by the movement of Toobin'.
  - It's nice how this mirrors the left and right hands, but being able to hold one direction and move in the other direction seems wrong.
- proto-2:
  - Hold a direction and press X to move in that direction. Z has no effect now.
  - Loses the feeling of using two hands, but much easier to mentally grasp, and frees up the Z button for something else.
- proto-3:
  - Adds a stamina bar that depletes with each button press, and regenerates slowly over time.
  - Inspired by the Temp meter in Excitebike.
  - At the moment it's too easy to get stuck and this should really regenerate faster if it stays.
  - This would also need some polish like a visual indication that your character is too tired to move.
